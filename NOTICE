This is a collection of Ansible-tasks organized as roles for deploying
Nextcloud. The substantial task-files itself are subject to the Apache License,
Version 2.0, and are marked as such.

Many of the files- and templates to deploy onto target machines have been taken
from a Debian bullseye system or have at least been inspired by such.

The files in roles/common/files/usercfg/ are a version of my personal user
config files ("dotfiles"). The bashrc was probably originally based on Debian's
default for new user accounts.
